String Replace Plugin for Joomla CMS

Replaces given string with set image. Just edit sysplug.php and sysplug.xml to your needs. 
<br>
I.e. on line 20 in sysplug.php replace 'Big 5 Concepts' with the string you want to replace followed by the path to the image and desired resolution. 

In sysplug.xml on line 17 change 'b5c-logo-signatur-1.png' to the actual filename. 

Download the zip and rename it to 'sysplug.zip'. Install as usual. 

This Plugin has been part of some fiddling with the Joomla CMS and first attempts in PHP development. Feel free to edit, contribute, change to your needs. I would be happy to see someone making something out of it. Anyways, at the end its a simple useless Plugin i developed mainly for learning purpose... 

This is a **System Plugin**, i.e. it replaces given string everywhere on **all** pages!
