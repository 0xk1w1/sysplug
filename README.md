String Replace Plugin for Joomla CMS

Replaces given string with set image. Just edit sysplug.php and sysplug.xml to your needs. 
I.e. on line 20 replace <br>'Big 5 Concepts' with the string you want to replace followed by the path to the image and desired resolution. <br>
In sysplug.xml on line 17 change 'b5c-logo-signatur-1.png' to the actual filename. 

This Plugin is working systemwide, i.e. it replaces given string everywhere on **all** pages!
